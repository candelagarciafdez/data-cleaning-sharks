# data-cleaning-sharks
Project when I clean a data set using `pandas`, `regex` and `seaborn`.

## Objectives

My objectives are **clean the dataset** to remove not relevant information, decide an hypothesis and support it with graphs (made with Seaborn).

## Methods
Some of data cleaning methods I used are:

- *string processing*
- *drop columns*
- *categorize information*
- *work with null values*

## Hypothesis

My hypothesis are: **man are more vulnerable to shark attacks** and **activities like surfing are more dangerous**.

## Disclaimer

My code is all commented, **feel free to do a pull request** to improve it :D
